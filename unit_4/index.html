 <p> Hey, my name is Anne-Laure & this is my photographic portfolio.<br />

 I grew up around the world, mainly in hot places, on the African continent & Pacific Islands. Before becoming the mum of a little boy in 2015, I worked in the travel industry, which is lucky as I quite like travelling! I am also incredibly blessed to be married to the most amazing being I know (Cheesy, I know. But true!). <br /> 

 To sum up, I am a traveller, a wife, a mum, definitely a "lost in transition" triathlete (reference to my ability to faff during triathlon transitions - cup of tea anyone?), a massive outdoors fan, a part-time hippie, a craft-lover not-so-extraordinaire. I am born French, German-educated, but now a London girl, where I live with our dog Chilli Pepper and two cats Gin & Tonic).<br />

 This portfolio reflects what I love most in life. You can also follow my adventures through my blog.</p>
